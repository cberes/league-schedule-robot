# league-schedule-robot

This website aggregates (sports) league schedules from several other websites. Schedules are shown in a single list. Pretty cool, right? I made this in 2012. I started with the HTML5 boilerplate template provided by some nice guy.

## Dependencies

- at least {HP 5.3
- MySQL database

This uses my [ooricooo](https://github.com/cberes/ooricoo) project for ORM, a copy of which is included.

## Configuration

The [resources.xml](resources.xml) file contains all configuration settings. This includes things like database settings, paths to error pages, and API credentials.
